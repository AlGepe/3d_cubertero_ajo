3D designs for cutlery drawer at home

## Progress Overview
- [x] Get dimensions
- [x] Validate dimensions IRL
- [ ] Create cutouts
- [ ] Create full blocks
- [ ] Print everything

## The goal

Organise the cutlery drawer by making custom 3D printed inserts to fit especific cutlery in the generic spaces already existing in the store-bough cutlery insert.

## Project breakdown

### Get dimensions [done]

First we will take measurements of the store-bought insert and try to guess the curvature radius for each dimension. Perfect fit is not required: the aim is functional, no perfect.

The measurements are stored in the corresponding files, each space has been named according to the picture above.

### Validate dimensions IRL [partially done]

Once the measurements are gathered a series of quick 3D printed prototypes will be used to validate the dimensions and adjust as needed to achieve a satisfactory fit in their corresposnding spaces

It is important to note that due to the size of the insert most will require to be printed in pieces and be connected aftewards. This will be done in Creality Printpe slicer using the dove tail option in the cutting tool. Tolerances will need to be tested. This might need to be tested separately, since the prototyping settings for printing will be optimized for speed and not precision.

### Create cutouts

Each type of cutlery will need an outline to be created and a cutout piece to be printed and tested. Other features that will need to be tested are the depth and the shape and size of the side space within each insert to make picking up the cutlery easy no matter now many pieces are left

### Print everything

This stage requires final layout of the cutlery to be decided. A compromise between space efficiency and ease of use will need to be agreed on.
