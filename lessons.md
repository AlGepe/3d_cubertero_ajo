1. The spaces in the store bought insert are not very precise but have a slight flexibility
2. The spaces in the store bought insert do not have walls at 90º the flare out ever so slightly
3. To correct for the flare a 18 mm fillet and -4 mm to the maximum dimensions seems to do the trick
4. Oversizing the outline by 1 mm is the correct choice. 1 mm seems too much, but testing 0.5 mm makes the fit way too tight.
5. The best approach is to create 3D objects for each item required (bought insert space, cutlery piece, finger hole) and combine them later, probably in the slicer
6. On dovetails in Creality Print, a tolerance value of 0.4 mm still requires deburring/sanding and force. Can't tell if it's due to the print quality of prototypes, but better to set 0.5 mm for final pieces and then reassess
7. A2 requires a -5 mm correction on the length
