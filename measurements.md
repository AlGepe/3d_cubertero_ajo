# Measurements (store-bought insert)
## Global
Thickness of plastic = 1.68 mm
Radius (fillet) = 18.80 mm (approx)
Depth = 42.7 mm
## A1
width = 75 mm
length = 130 mm
## A2
width = 75 mm
length = 273 mm
## B1
width = 90 mm
length = 273 mm
## B1
width = 187 mm
length = 410 mm
## C1
width = 85 mm
length = 242 mm

## Adjustment for 3D modelling

All width/length measurements are taking at the widest/longest points so a -4 mm correction should be applied to the 3D model. This will leavea small gap at the top but has proven to give a tight enough fit that the printed inserts don't move around
